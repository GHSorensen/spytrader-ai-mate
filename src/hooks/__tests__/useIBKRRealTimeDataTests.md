# IBKR Real-Time Data Tests

These tests have been refactored into smaller, more focused test files:

1. `useIBKRRealTimeData.test.tsx` - Tests the main hook functionality
2. `useIBKRStatusCombiner.test.tsx` - Tests the status combining hook
3. `useIBKRErrorHandler.test.tsx` - Tests the error handling hook
4. `useIBKRConnectionCheck.test.tsx` - Tests the connection checking hook
5. `useIBKRDataRefresh.test.tsx` - Tests the data refreshing hook

Each test file focuses on a specific hook's functionality, making the tests more maintainable and easier to understand.

The shared test utilities are in `useIBKRTestUtils.ts`.
